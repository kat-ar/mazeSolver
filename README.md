# mazeSolver
This maze solver is based on bootdev tutorial to be found under this link https://blog.boot.dev/backend/best-backend-projects/#project-2-a-visual-maze-solverhttpsbootdevbuildmaze-solver-python

To date there is no implemented extension to this project, but coming:
* Game-likeness of maze solving (maze solved by user, not alghorithm)
* User-alghorithm racing
